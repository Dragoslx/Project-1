                    <p>Welcome to the official EthPyramid blog. Here you’ll find news about recent or upcoming events as well as on-going developments in progress. First things first – let’s talk about our very successful launch!</p>

<h1 id="blogpost-4">Blogpost #4</h1>

<p>Apologies, blogposts #1-3 were lost in the pyramid. 
¯_(ツ)_/¯</p>

<p>(Their screaming souls were lost to the ether; but though they now lay piled under the exponentially growing blocks of love, their sacrifice will never be forgotten.)</p>

<h2 id="launch-recap">Launch recap</h2>

<p>As many in our growing community know, the cryptocurrency pyramid concept is relatively new but holds great potential. Following the recent failures of other groups and individuals who were focused far too much on short-term gain than long-term growth and transparency, an initially small (but now wonderfully large) community banded together to build a new pyramid system; together and from the ground up. A system whereby each and everybody who got involved at any stage in time would benefit if they only were to have strong, smart hands. Our fantastic dev team worked all hours to come up with something very special and we were proud to share it with you the very minute it was finally launched (after days of rigorous testing and re-testing).</p>

<p>It’s early days yet, but everybody involved from the ground floor up considers the public opening of EthPyramid a massive success; those who were on the camel during launch saw an incredible run, hitting 500k within the first 10 minutes, and dropping almost 200k shortly after – only to begin rising again. This is most likely due to general fear of contract failure or exit scams – not to mention the general feeling of discomfort in the crypto-currency space itself. Some early participators cashed out right away – nobody could blame them after all the recent drama, but they’re probably kicking themselves now knowing all the sweet dividends they’ve missed! What followed afterwards however has only strengthened the pyramid and general faith in the concept. The contract balance shot back up past 400k and has seen steady growth in volume since; with several dips, peaks and valleys as well as – most importantly – a continual rise in new contributors.</p>

<h2 id="strengthening-the-pyramids-structure">Strengthening the pyramid’s structure</h2>

<p>As many know, our main developer dropped 5 eth in to get the pyramid started, with each dev following shortly with .5 eth. We figured this was a fair way to allow the people who worked hard to bring everyone this massive pyramid a way to get in early and keep incentive to continue working on the site for all involved. Some criticism came back that the initial 5eth buy-in (+5 eth after launch) simply “held too many tokens” and was reaping far too much of the dividend pot. While nothing in comparison to recent games of these types, we still took this criticism seriously – but a solution to quell any potentially unhappy feeling from our foundational community was already in the works.</p>

<h2 id="at-about-1630pm-utc-on-friday-the-2nd-the-development-team-came-to-a-decision-inspired-both-by-feedback-from-the-community-as-well-as-a-general-desire-to-continue-the-pyramid-in-a-spirit-of-egalitarian-opportunity-the-top-of-the-pyramid-was-sold">At about 16:30PM UTC on Friday the 2nd the development team came to a decision; inspired both by feedback from the community as well as a general desire to continue the pyramid in a spirit of egalitarian opportunity, the top of the pyramid was sold.</h2>

<p>The initial 5 eth(+5 eth at launch) put in cashed out all tokens - and to prove our unshaken confidence in the systems long-term potential has reinvested 10eth after. These “sold” tokens were burned and as a result everybody remaining with their steady hands afterward had an even greater share of the market than before. If you’re curious, you can check it all out here;</p>

<h2 id="even-more-for-all--spread-the-love">Even more for all – spread the love!</h2>

<p>The aforementioned act evened out token distribution substantially; making the pyramid even more egalitarian as well as providing a SIGNIFICANT windfall of dividends to current faithfuls immediately upon transaction execution, as well as increasing the total share of tokens for all the current and future pyramid workers.
As we knew would happen, a few foolishly thought “the end” was nigh- but our foundational concepts of longevity and stability juxtaposed with steady growth (not to mention adrenaline-fueled roller-coaster rides) for all were proven correct; some sold, but even more bought in further as the price dropped temporarily and invitingly. Participation in the EthPyramid has been growing steadily since good news for the structure of this pyramid and all those who work and play on it!</p>

<p>As recent events have indicated, many people are trying to (and have recently succeeded, for some contracts) exploit certain vulnerabilities unnecessarily left in contracts. Rest assured that our wonderful dev team has solved all of these - as promised:

Another unofficial/unaffiliated but interesting project related to ours;</p>

<p>This project, which searches etherscan.io and aggregates all identical contracts and provides a comparison and a back-up gui interface to interact with. While we do not recommend participating in any pyramid (even our own) it can’t hurt to bookmark this as a backup!</p>

<h3 id="so-whats-next-for-the-ethpyramid">So what’s next for the EthPyramid?</h3>

<p>As the pyramid continues to grow – fed by crashes and confidence both - we’ll be wanting to look to spread the word of our vision. This is truly the first scalable, functional, and safe pyramid to play with. The added functionality of 10% sells to each holder when somebody decides to pull out, the quick and easy reinvest option and the ever-present, constantly active and reassuringly transparent development team participation has never been more rewarding.</p>

<p>From here on we’ll be looking to continue to update https://ethpyramid.com for user experience, functionality, and over-all appeal as well as broaden awareness so that others can join in. In these volatile times, no sector of any market is truly “safe” - but you can trust our fastidiously devised smart contract to keep your beer money in a place where it can only grow in value the longer your hands stay strong.</p>

<p>There’s already some great things in the works – tools, web design improvements, translations and community growth all; and expanding progress in fronts will play a vital role in the continued growth of the community. If you have suggestions for any further developments, please communicate with us and the community in the #dev-chat channel on our discord server – link again here for your convenience.</p>

<p>We hope you’ve profited so far and have steadily grown more confident in the system! We know it works and we hope soon more and more people will see this for themselves. As always, don’t put in anything you’re not afraid to lose – we know there’s a very good chance you’ll do extremely well (especially now that the price of Ethereum itself is bouncing back) but either way we can most certainly promise one hell of a fun ride!  We’ll do our very best to answer any and all questions you might have. Stay tuned for more, and in the meantime, stay safe, play responsibly and have a great rest of the weekend.</p>
